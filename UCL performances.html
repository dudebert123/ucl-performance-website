      <h1>The 3 Best Individual Performances of the 2024/25 Champions League</h1>
      <p>
        This past UEFA Champions League gave us some exhilarating matches,
        and in those matches, some players stole the spotlight with their performances.
        These are what I consider the best 3 individual performances where these players
        not only shined the most but also had massive impact on the game from whistle 
        to whistle.

        <h2>#3. Alisson Becker vs PSG, RO16 leg 1</h2>
        <p>
          As a Liverpool fan myself, this match was extremely stressful to watch,
          an if not for Alisson putting up one of the greatest goalkeeping peformances of
          the modern era, we would have lost by about 10 goals. PSG's attack was utterly
          relentless in this game, but there was 1 thing standing - or in this case, diving, 
          in their way - Alisson Becker. Liverpool were able to leave the Parc de Princes
          that night without having conceded a single goal despite having had 
          shot on goal 25 times less than PSG a possestion rate just under 30%.

        <h2>#2. Nuno Mendes vs Liverpool, RO16 leg 2</h2>
        <p>
          Nuno Mendes put up astonishing performances in both legs of this tie against
          Liverpool, and I think the way he set the tone in leg 1 was both infuriating 
          and incredible. Being a fullback on the left side of the pitch for PSG meant 
          Mendes was going up against the player with the most goals, assists, and big 
          chances created in the entire Premier League that season, Mohamed Salah. 
          Yet, despite Salah's otherworldly ability to attack any space he can find 
          and create huge goalscoring opportunities for him and his
          teammates, he was unable to break the defensive lock of Nuno Mendes. Mendes' 
          lock-down defense on Salah in the first game is a massive reason for Liverpool's
          underwhelming attacking stats in that first game as our attack relied on Salah 
          extremely heavily, meaning Mendes locking him up stunted Liverpool's attacking
          strength by a huge ammount.

        <h2>#1. Lamine Yamal vs Inter Milan, semi-final leg 2</h2>
        <p>
          Being one of the most promising and talked about players in world football
          over the past 12 months, there was an incredible amount of pressure being put
          on then 17-year-old Lamine Yamal heading into his first ever UCL semi-final. 
          The problem with this, however, is that Lamine doesn't seem to feel pressure.
          In game 1 of this tie, Lamine scored Barcelona's first of the match in the 24th 
          minute to get them back in the game after going 2-0 down early to Inter. By this
          time, it was starting to become evident that performing at this stage was not a 
          concern, and that he was a threat to be reckoned with despite his age or lack of 
          experience. Lamine ended the first game having had scored once and hit the post 
          twice. Yet this great game 1 peformance would be outdone by Lamine in the 2nd leg,
          where he put up one of the best 0 G/A attacking performances in recent UCL history
          in one of the most heartbreaking losses for Barcelona that I can remember. The longer
          this game went on, the more clear it became that simly giving the ball to Lamine and 
          crossing their fingers was Barcelona's only answer to Inter's elite defense and 
          midfield. It seemed as though no matter what the situation was, if Lamine had the ball,
          he would find a way to make himself a threat. After watching Lamine beat his man over
          and over and over, Inter just resorted to fouling him in order to stop him from getting
          anywhere near the box. Lamine's unending threat to Inter's world-class defense 
          as well as his ability to cut through said defense and require Inter to put practically
          half of their team on 'For The Love of God Don't Let That Kid Touch The Ball' duty
          was one of the biggest showings of his promise and a massive statement to anyone 
          doubting him, and was in my opinion the most impressive performance of this year's 
          Champions League season.
